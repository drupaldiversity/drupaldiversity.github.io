The Drupal Diversity working group was established in June 2016 after DrupalCon New Orleans.  We began meeting regularly and in our ~6 months of activity, we have:

- established a <a href="https://twitter.com/drupaldiversity">twitter account</a> and increased followers from 0 to 136
- established the #diversity-inclusion room in slack, where membership is now 130
- crowd-sourced the creation of the <a href="https://drupaldiversity.github.io/diversity-of-the-web/">Diversity of the Web</a> survey
- worked with the Drupal Association to establish the Inclusion Fund
- supported the announcement of <a href="https://events.drupal.org/news/setting-diversity-drupalcon-goal">diversity as a priority</a> to DrupalCon organizers and session track committee members
