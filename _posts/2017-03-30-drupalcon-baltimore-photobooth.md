This year at DrupalCon, the Drupal Diversity & Inclusion Working Group will have a booth in the
exhibit hall. We plan to have a fun and engaging activity for visitors, which will involve taking their
photo and printing it out with an imposed filter that says “This is what a Drupalist looks like!” or
similar. We plan to hang these photos as a collage behind our booth, post them to instagram
(<a href="http://instagram.com/drupaldiversity">drupaldiversity</a>), and offer a copy to each visitor. We want to show how diverse the Drupal
community is with a fun and striking visual.

We are a volunteer organization, so we rely on donations to fund this activity. The cost of the
printer is $162, and can be used in the future. The film) is about $12.49 for 20 photos.
Our goal at DrupalCon is to have at least 200 visitors participate each day that the exhibit hall is
open. That’s 600 visitors, and if we offer them a printout, we would need 1200 photos, at a cost
of approximately $750. With the cost of the printer, our total cost is about $912. We can’t do this
without your support.

Our mission is important, and we are dedicated to engaging the community at DrupalCon this
year. Your in-kind donation can be made via a purchase at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/ref=cm_reg_rd-upd?ie=UTF8&id=3UJNHW05BVHJ&type=wishlist">this convenient Amazon wishlist</a>, and,
while not tax-deductible, is very much appreciated. We ask that any in-kind donations are placed
by April 15.

If you’d rather make a cash donation, please contact <a href="mailto:nikki@kanopistudios.com">Nikki Stevens</a>. If you have questions about the project itself, please contact <a href="mailto:alanna@chromatichq.com">Alanna Burke</a>.


Thank you,

Alanna Burke, Nikki Stevens and the rest of the Drupal Diversity & Inclusion Working Group
