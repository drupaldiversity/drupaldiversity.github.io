### Current Initiatives
The Drupal Diversity Working Group (DDWG) is currently working on the following projects:

   * <a href="https://github.com/drupaldiversity/event-organizer-packet">Organizer Packet</a> A resource for organizers to help them organize and support diverse and inclusive events

   * <a href="https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues">Infrastructural improvements</a> to the DDWG website & online presence

### Past Initiatives

   * Organized BOF (Birds of a Feather) sessions at Drupalcon Baltimore that embraced and represented the interests and identities of Drupal community members.
   * Ran a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAreDrupal?src=hash">#WeAreDrupal</a> photo booth during DrupalCon Baltimore.

### Get Involved

We welcome all types of contributors - programmers, content managers, project support staff, and more.  However you identify as a contributor and as part of the Drupal community, there is a place for you to get involved here.


#### Getting started

0. Come into the #diversity-inclusion room in the Drupal Slack and say hello!
(You can get an automatic invite at <a href="http://drupalslack.herokuapp.com">http://drupalslack.herokuapp.com</a> if you need one.) If Slack doesn't work for you, you can reach out to us on twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/drupaldiversity">@drupaldiversity</a>

1. Join us for a meeting.  We meet in #diversity-inclusion every Thursday at 9am PST / 17:00pm UTC (The <a href="http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/">Time Zone Converter</a> is handy for this).  You can see our calendar of meetings and sprints below.

2. If there is an issue open in *any* of our <a href="https://github.com/drupaldiversity">github repositories</a>, it's available to be worked on. We *love* to see people in the issue queues, and welcome people jumping in wherever they feel comfortable.  We try to label issues so that newcomers can quickly find tasks that match their interests.  We borrowed this idea from <a href="https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-website/issues">Girl Develop It's issue queue.</a>

#### Contributor Code of Conduct
As we advocate for the Drupal community to be diverse and inclusive, we are aware that as a working group, we must also work to be inclusive, respectful and diverse.  We've adopted the <a href="http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/">contributor code of conduct</a> created by Contributor Convenant.

(You can review the discussion that lead to this decision <a href="https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues/13">here</a>)
