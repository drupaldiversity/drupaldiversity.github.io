**Affiliations**
- _Are you a part of the Drupal Association?_
No. We're a collective of volunteers.

- _Didn't you have space in the Drupal Association's booth at DrupalCon Baltimore?_
Yes. They donated it to us.

- _Why?_
Honestly, we didn't ask. We don't have the money to buy a booth space, so we took the gift we were offered.

- _Did Dries have anything to do with it?_
No, nothing.

**Funding**

We are a collective of volunteers that neither handles money nor has a way to receive or disburse funds.

- _Who bought the booth space?_
No one. The Drupal Association donated it.

- _Who paid for the stickers?_
Digital Echidna, and they offered to do so anonymously.  (I - Nikki - don't feel comfortable setting a precedent of anonymous donors and so would prefer to give them credit. )

- _Who paid for the photo booth supplies?_
We posted an Amazon Wishlist and organization(s) bought items from it.  We have no way of knowing who bought what.

**Membership and Opinions**
-_Who are you?_
We're a collective of volunteers who started a grass-roots efforts to build a truly diverse and inclusive Drupal Community.

- _Who speaks for the group?_
No one. All text that appears on the website is crowd-sourced. [Our twitter account](twitter.com/drupaldiversity "Our twitter account") is run by @Ruby, but her goal is to write objectively. Most of our tweets will be informative and we aim to avoid opinions or interpretations.

- _"I saw @username say 'controversial thing' on twitter. Does DD&I believe the same thing?"_
We're made up of individuals who have their own opinions.  All of them are free to speak their minds in every venue in which they participate.

- _What is your position on [controversial person or situation]._
We don't have one.

_"I want to be involved and help make these decisions. How can I?"_
We make both decisions and recommendations (mostly recommendations it seems) for many things.  If you wish to have a voice in making decisions about Drupal governance, Drupal's Slack has a #governance channel.

If you wish to join your voice to ours, please do! We meet every Thursday in the slack channel at 9 PST/ 12 EST / 17 UTC.
